			<p class="text-body">
				&emsp; It seemed like all of Montreal was outside celebrating the first true day of spring. Men in crisp suits walked briskly through the park, simultaneously relieved to be free of the stuffy office and anxious to return. Women moved their gossip from cafe tables to park benches, thrilled to have both a larger audience and more people to observe. I gave everyone a wide berth, finding solitude at the base of an oak tree. This proved to be both a blessing and a curse: its branches shielded me from the blather of people, but also blocked out the warmth of the sun, defeating the entire purpose of the first real excursion I had made outside in weeks. <br>
				&emsp; A sound- almost like wind chimes, or keys jingling- alerted me to your approach. You walked slowly; unlike everyone else you were taking your time, taking everything in as if it were your first spring. Your hair reflected the sun’s rays perfectly, lighting you up like a star. I knew that spring wasn’t melting just the snow, but the frost that had buried my heart. You brought the sun with you, much to the oak’s chagrin.  <br>
				&emsp; I started imagining what it would be like to be near you. What it would feel like to have you sit in my lap, to hold you close, to run my hands through each golden strand of your hair. I imagine looking deep into your brown eyes, my smile paling in comparison to yours, and showing quite a bit less tongue. I imagined placing a gentle kiss on your forehead. <br>
				&emsp; I had been so lost in thought that I almost hadn’t noticed you walk away, and I cursed myself for not having the guts to approach you. You turned around to see me one last time, flashing me with that trademarked smile, and continued on your merry way, tail wagging as you trotted happily alongside your companion.
