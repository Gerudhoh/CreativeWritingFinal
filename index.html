				  &emsp; I’d never seen anyone as happy as you were on that spring day at Parc Lahaie. I loved the way you stopped every so often, a flower catching your eye, and wandered off the path to give it a sniff. The smile that the flowers drew was infectious. Watching you, sharing in your childlike wonder for the new world around us, made me happy for the first time in a long, long time.
				  <br> &emsp; I wish I’d been less shy, I wish I’d come up to you and said hello. You’re blonde and you’re beautiful, both inside and out. I hope that this finds you and that we can reunite, so you can show me your favourite flowers in your favourite parks.

				  Liquor is liquid luck. It was pure luck that I bumped into you- quite literally- as I was leaving the engagement party last Saturday night.   <br>
				  Liquor is liquid strength. I felt it course through my muscles and grant me the power to hoist you off the ground- you were so drunk that getting you to your feet was no simple task. <br>
				  Liquor is liquid courage. How else would I have worked up the nerves to kiss you?  <br>
				  Liquor is liquid love. You melted my heart and drank it down in one deft gulp, like when you took a swig from my flask.  <br>
				  <br>But here's the thing about liquid, it's ever flowing, ever moving- your name, your number, your Snapchat handle, they all poured from my brain out my ears as I leaned in to give you that kiss.   <br>
				  If you're reading this, reply with the shape of my flask and what we were drinking so that I know it's you. (I'd like to think that even if you forget my name, you'll remember those sparks that we're flying between us) <br>
