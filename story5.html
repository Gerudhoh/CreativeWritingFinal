						&emsp; The phone went off, flashing light blinding me. I had been waiting for Jeorff to respond to me ever since the incident. Italics there, underline it. The incident. But it wasn’t a message from Jeorff, really; just a picture: Lisa with a flashy ring on her left hand, a twinkle in her eyes. A message about a party next Saturday.
						<br>&emsp; I like Lisa. Lisa was one of the few of Jeorff’s bimbos who I could actually have a fucking conversation with without wanting to deepthroat a fucking strap. Lisa. Lisa. Lisa. Did he say her name when he boinked that girl from the club? Why Jeorff? How do you tolerate Jeorff so long? Stuck with that asshole, forever? Big bimbo energy. Jeorff. Engaged to Lisa? She didn’t know- she couldn’t. Fucking degenerate. You gotta boink someone else to know who’s really the one? Lisa deserved to know… but she wouldn’t fucking believe me, would she? No. Jeorff would see to that. Silver-tongue, micro-penis, wandering-eye fucking Jeorff. He had to be the one to tell her. But how to get that slimy little himbo to confess?
						<br>&emsp;Torture, duh. Everyone knows torture is a surefire way to get 100% genuine confessions out of weak little micro fucks. OOoh you’re a mean one Mr Carl. First, get her, then it’s party time babey! It wouldn’t even be hard to find her. Everyone was looking at Missed Connections. Everyone wanted to be seen. To be loved by strangers. I didn’t fucking get it- it’s weird when I holler at a catcaller across the subway that I want to eat his ass, but you put that on the internet and they go bonkers fucking yonkers. They all do. This other woman (italics) would be no different. I carefully crafted my missed connection. 
						<br>&emsp;She replied within the hour. “It was me.”
						<br>&emsp;“Prove it. What’s his ass look like?” 
						<br>&emsp;“Like someone smeared mayonnaise on a slice of toast and sprinkled just a tiny bit of paprika over it.” 
						<br>&emsp;So. It was her. Looks like I had a plus one.
						<br>&emsp;***
						<br>&emsp;I’m a perfect gentleman, so I picked Jasmine up at her apartment. She wore the same short, tight, pink dress as that night of the incident. It was wildly inappropriate. It was perfect. We weren’t the first to arrive at the engagement party, but we were the first people to arrive bonkered out of our fucking skulls. Good. One hand on Jasmine’s ass, I shot Lisa a congratulatory finger gun. Jeorff’s face went fucking pale, like he’d just fallen face-first into a puddle of elephant jizz.
						<br>&emsp;“Hi Jeff.” Jasmine purred. Purred? What a fucking freak.
						<br>&emsp;“You must be er… Carl’s girlfriend.” Jeorff responded. Mr cum-face over there wouldn’t look at me, but I could tell he was fuming.
						<br>&emsp;“Yeah, this is my Snazzy Jazzy!”
						<br>&emsp;“Jasmine” She corrected. My b!
						<br>&emsp;“Well it’s nice to meet you Jasmine.” Said Lisa, who was trying to give Jeorff a look (Carl has a girlfriend? Why didn’t you tell me Carl had a girlfriend?) but failing to catch his eye.
						<br>&emsp;“Is this a fucking party or what? Let’s get some tunes up in here! You got a DJ? I thought I made it clear I had a comprehensive playlist prepared for tonight…. Weird fucking flex but ok I guess. Yo DJ! You and I are gonna be best fucking friends tonight pal, I have just a couple requests for ya… How about we start with the CLASSIC Get this Party Started by P!NK?”
						<br>&emsp;“Carl, we've talked about you hitting on my Alexa.”
						<br>&emsp;“Can’t hear you over the fucking vibes Jeorff! Let’s dance baby!”
						<br>&emsp;***
						<br>&emsp;“Yeah, so like my dick is curved to the left, kind of like a dough hook on one of those mixing thingies. But you know, you can’t go sticking a dough hook up your coochie without getting a yeast infection whereas boinking me has only like a 30% chance of getting a yeast infection, you feel? What do you mean you don’t know what a dough hook is? You don’t watch the Great British Bake Off? Are you out of your goddamn mind?!”
						<br>&emsp;“Carl, how about you stop talking to my immigrant grandmother and go grab me another drink, eh pal?” Jeorff pleaded. 
						<br>&emsp;“Fucking fine Jeorff, geezus. That old bat hasn’t seen Bakeoff? She’s never stared into the piercing blue eyes of Paul Hollywood? She’s never heard him complain about a tart’s soggy bottom? It makes me sick. I don’t even want to talk to her.”
						<br>&emsp;“Rum and Coke, please.”
						<br>&emsp;I walked over to the bar slowly, stopping every so often to pick up the shards of my faith in humanity which had been single-handedly shattered by that elderly Korean witch. No one was at the bar but Lisa.
						<br>&emsp;“I like your new gf Carl,” said Lisa.
						<br>&emsp;“Yeah me too,” I grinned, “I mean she is like, hypnotically caucasian and she did moan another man's name when I boinked her on the way here but you know- win some lose most. So weird too because I don't even know a 'jeff’. It wasn't even the Uber driver's name either. I think he was called Manav or something- hey Lisa where did you go?”
						<br>&emsp;Her reply came from across the room. “I knew something was fishy. I knew Carl wouldn't really date a girl like Jasmine- or that a girl like her would date Carl! You slept with her, didn't you Jeff?”
						<br>&emsp;“Who told you that? Carl? I mean I love the guy, but Babe you know you can't listen to a thing he says.”
						<br>&emsp;"Carl didn't have to tell me- I see it on your face every time you look in her direction.” Jeorff’s face fell, like someone bonked him over the head with a frozen sturgeon. “And Jeff? I think Carl's one of the most honest people I know"
						<br>&emsp;Like I said- big bimbo energy. 
						<br>&emsp;Lisa threw her drink at Jeff and stormed off. Everyone was silent, stunned, speechless, but I knew what to do. I ran to the DJ's station and grabbed the aux cord from that rat bastard. I didn't even have to search for the song, it was already queued on my phone. I pressed play. 
						<br>&emsp;Oops I did it again...
